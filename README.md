# @italomagno/accre-app

## Overview
I noticed that my colleagues were having difficulty managing their operational shifts, so I developed this app to streamline the process. With it, users can see the remaining shifts available for each day and fill the necessary slots, much like selecting seats in a cinema. As the slots are filled, they become unavailable to other users.

## Features
- ðŸš€ **Dynamic Shift Management** - Easily manage shifts with a system that updates in real-time as users select and fill available slots.
- ðŸŽ¨ **User-Friendly Interface** - Designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making shift management seamless.
- ðŸ”„ **Real-Time Updates** - Ensures accurate and up-to-date shift availability as changes happen instantly.
- âš¡ **Built with Chakra UI & Next.js** - A robust, scalable, and visually appealing application.
- ðŸ“Š **Custom Google Sheets Database** - A simple yet effective backend for storing and managing shift data.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Chakra UI
- **Backend:** Google Sheets as a database, Google APIs
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Recommended)
